# React & Redux course

Code in this repo is following the [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/overview) course on Udemy, taught by [@StephenGrider](https://github.com/StephenGrider). Reference code is in the [redux-code](https://github.com/StephenGrider/redux-code) repo.

The final project in the first half of the course is a small video app which gets videos from the [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/). See it deployed on Github Pages at [sauntimo.github.io/react-redux-course](https://sauntimo.github.io/react-redux-course).
